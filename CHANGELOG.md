## [1.0.0] - 2024-06-26

### Added
- Initial release of Video Frame Analyzer
- FastAPI-based REST API for video processing
- Video upload and frame extraction functionality
- Color histogram-based feature extraction
- Qdrant vector database integration for similarity search
- Comprehensive API documentation with Swagger UI
- Support for multiple video formats (MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV, WMV)
- Support for multiple image formats (JPG, JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIFF)
- Configurable frame extraction intervals
- Similarity search with cosine similarity metric
- CORS support for web applications
- Comprehensive test suite with unit and integration tests
- Docker support for containerized deployment
- Detailed README with usage examples and deployment guides

### Features
- **Video Processing**: Extract frames from videos at specified intervals
- **Feature Extraction**: Compute 96-dimensional color histogram features
- **Vector Storage**: Store and retrieve feature vectors using Qdrant
- **Similarity Search**: Find similar frames based on visual content
- **RESTful API**: Complete REST API with automatic documentation
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with detailed error messages
- **File Management**: Automatic cleanup and organized file storage

### API Endpoints
- `GET /` - Root endpoint with API information
- `GET /health` - Health check endpoint
- `POST /upload-video` - Upload and process video files
- `POST /search-similar` - Search for similar frames
- `GET /frame/{frame_id}` - Retrieve specific frame images
- `GET /frames` - List all available frames

### Technical Specifications
- **Framework**: FastAPI 0.115.6
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV 4.11.0.86
- **Vector Database**: Qdrant Client 1.14.3
- **Feature Dimensions**: 96 (32 bins Ã— 3 color channels)
- **Similarity Metric**: Cosine similarity
- **Supported Python**: 3.8+

### Documentation
- Comprehensive README with installation and usage instructions
- Interactive API documentation via Swagger UI
- Code examples in Python, JavaScript, and cURL
- Docker deployment configuration
- Performance optimization guidelines
- Security considerations and best practices

### Testing
- Unit tests for all core components
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end workflow testing
- Performance and load testing capabilities

## [Unreleased]

### Planned Features
- GPU acceleration for feature extraction
- Additional similarity metrics (Euclidean, Manhattan)
- Batch processing for multiple videos
- Advanced feature extraction methods (SIFT, ORB)
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting and API quotas
- Caching layer for improved performance
- Monitoring and metrics collection
- Database migration tools
- CLI interface for batch operations

### Known Issues
- Large video files may consume significant memory during processing
- Similarity search performance may degrade with very large datasets
- Limited to in-memory Qdrant instance (production should use persistent storage)

### Future Enhancements
- Support for additional video formats
- Real-time video stream processing
- Machine learning-based feature extraction
- Advanced similarity algorithms
- Distributed processing capabilities
- Web interface for easier interaction
- Integration with cloud storage services
- Advanced analytics and reporting features
